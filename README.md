# video-downloader-llm-pdf-pokertracker

I wish to create add a feature to this where i can download a video using pytube and then extract the frames, from those frames i feed the LLM them into a PDF storybook and then the LLM analyses them (GPT4o) and then starts to compile a pokerstars hand history compilation that can be downloaded. I then wish to create a databaseSQL and implement a Poker tracker python software that will show the stats of the player in the form of graph and also stats.
